# Projects

- **[Stock Trade Compression](https://github.com/gringasalpastor/stock-trade-compression)**
    - Compresses a sequence of stock trades using a separate Huffman tree optimized for each data column (price, time, symbol, etc) â€“ Each value in the Huffman tree is pre-encoded as the difference between the value of its prediction algorithm and its self to minimize variation
    - Outperforms generic Huffman coding based `bzip2` (`77.8%` vs. `90.4%`) by using data predictions specific to each data column
- **[Blackjack Study](https://github.com/gringasalpastor/blackjack-study)**
    - Application to practice basic strategy for various rule variants of the game of blackjack
    - Focused practice for less common events like soft hands and paired hands

- **Other**
    - [Google Foo Bar Problems](https://github.com/gringasalpastor/google-foobar)
    - [Binomial Coefficient Counting Challenge](https://github.com/gringasalpastor/m-choose-n-words)
